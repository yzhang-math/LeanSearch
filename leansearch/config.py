1. Make only small changes but be sure to make some change.
2. Try to keep the proofs concise.
3. Your response should be an implementation of the theorem <theorem_name>_vX (where X is the current iteration number).
4. You may use tactics only.
5. Be concise with your comments.
The code you generate will be verified using Lean 4.
